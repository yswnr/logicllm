The first premise states that if people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events. However, the second premise states that people either attend and are very engaged with school events or are inactive and disinterested members of their community. Therefore, it is possible that Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, but it is also possible that she is an inactive and disinterested member of her community and does not perform in school talent shows often."

While it is true that many wealthy individuals and celebrities have homes or investments in tax havens, it is not a universal rule that all well-paid people live in tax havens. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Djokovic lives in a tax haven with certainty."

We can start by defining the predicates and the premises.\n\nPredicates:\n\n* Dependent(x) ::: x is a person dependent on caffeine.\n* Drinks(x) ::: x regularly drinks coffee.\n* Jokes(x) ::: x jokes about being addicted to caffeine.\n* Unaware(x) ::: x is unaware that caffeine is a drug.\n* Student(x) ::: x is a student.\n\nPremises:\n\n* ∀x (Drinks(x) → Dependent(x)) ::: All people who regularly drink coffee are dependent on caffeine.\n* ∀x (Drinks(x) ⊕ Jokes(x)) ::: People either regularly drink coffee or joke about being addicted to caffeine.\n* ∀x (Jokes(x) → ¬Unaware(x)) ::: No one who jokes about being addicted to caffeine is unaware that caffeine is a drug.\n* (Student(rina) ∧ Unaware(rina)) ⊕ ¬(Student(rina) ∨ Unaware(rina)) ::: Rina is either a student and unaware that caffeine is a drug, or neither a student nor unaware that caffeine is a drug.\n* ¬(Dependent(rina) ∧ Student(rina)) → (Dependent(rina) ∧ Student(rina)) ⊕ ¬(Dependent(rina) ∨ Student(rina)) ::: If Rina is not a person dependent on caffeine and a student, then Rina is either a person dependent on caffeine and a student, or neither a person dependent on caffeine nor a student.\n\nNow we can start parsing the question.\n\nQuestion:\nBased on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Rina is either a person who jokes about being addicted to caffeine or is unaware that caffeine is a drug.\n\nWe can represent the statement as:\n\nJokes(rina) ⊕ Unaware(rina)\n\nUsing the predicates and premises defined above, we can evaluate the statement as follows:\n\nJokes(rina) ::: Rina jokes about being addicted to caffeine (premise 3)\nUnaware(rina) ::: Rina is unaware that caffeine is a drug (premise 4)\n\nSo, the statement is true.\n\n###\n\nIn the second problem, we have to parse the given information into first-order logic formulars. We can start by defining the predicates and the premises.\n\nPredicates:\n\n* Kind(x) ::: x is kind.\n* Ugly(x) ::: x is ugly.\n* Handsome(x) ::: x is handsome.\n* Gentleman(x) ::: x is a gentleman.\n* CEO(x) ::: x is a CEO.\n\nPremises:\n\n* ∀x (Ugly(x) → Kind(x)) ::: No one who is ugly is kind.\n* ∀x (Handsome(x) → Gentleman(x)) ::: All handsome people are gentlemen.\n* ∀x (Gentleman(x) → CEO(x)) ::: All gentlemen are CEOs.\n* Harry is Gentleman(harry) ::: Harry is a gentleman.\n\nNow we can start parsing the question.\n\nQuestion:\nBased on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Harry is kind or a CEO.\n\nWe can represent the statement as:\n\nKind(harry) ∨ CEO(harry)\n\nUsing the predicates and premises defined above, we can evaluate the statement as follows:\n\nKind(harry) ::: Harry is a gentleman (premise 5)\nCEO(harry) ::: Harry is a CEO (premise 6)\n\nSo, the statement is true.\n\n###\n\nIn both problems, we have used first-order logic to parse the given information and evaluate the questions. First-order logic provides a formal framework for reasoning about statements and their truth values. By using first-order logic, we can express complex relationships between statements and evaluate them based on the given information."

In this case, we have two predicates (Dependent and Student) and two premises (all people who regularly drink coffee are dependent on caffeine, and people either regularly drink coffee or joke about being addicted to caffeine). We can translate these premises into the logical operators using the grammar defined above.\n\nFor example, the first premise can be translated as:\n\n∀x (Drinks(x) → Dependent(x))\n\nWhich means \"for all x, if x regularly drinks coffee, then x is dependent on caffeine.\"\n\nSimilarly, the second premise can be translated as:\n\n∀x (Drinks(x) ⊕ Jokes(x))\n\nWhich means \"for all x, either x regularly drinks coffee or x jokes about being addicted to caffeine.\"\n\nOnce we have translated the premises into the appropriate logical operators, we can use the grammar to construct the formula for the problem and the question.\n\nFor the problem, we can use the formula:\n\n¬(Dependent(x) ∧ Student(x)) → (Dependent(x) ∧ Student(x)) ⊕ ¬(Dependent(x) ∨ Student(x))\n\nWhich means \"not (dependent on caffeine and a student) implies (dependent on caffeine and a student) or not (dependent on caffeine or a student).\"\n\nFor the question, we can use the formula:\n\nJokes(rina) ⊕ Unaware(rina)\n\nWhich means \"(Rina jokes about being addicted to caffeine or Rina is unaware that caffeine is a drug) or (Rina is neither a person who jokes about being addicted to caffeine nor unaware that caffeine is a drug).\"\n\nIn summary, to parse a problem and a question into first-order logic formulars, we need to identify the predicates and the premises, and then translate them into the appropriate logical operators using the grammar defined above."

All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly. All people who fulfill their nutritional daily intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes. If people have good relationships with their parents, then they fulfill their nutritional daily intakes. If people have good relationships with their parents, then they do not eat salads regularly.

It is either both true that Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and she has a good relationship with her parents, or it is true that Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents.\nQuestion:\nBased on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day.\n###\nPredicates:\nConscious(x) ::: x is very conscious about their health and eating habits.\nGrewUp(x, y) ::: x grew up in y.\nNutritionalIntake(x) ::: x fulfills their daily nutritional intake.\nRelationship(x, y) ::: x has a good relationship with y.\nVisit(x, y) ::: x visits y at least once a day.\nPremises:\n∀x (EatSalads(x) → Conscious(x)) ::: All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.\n∀x (GrewUp(x, y) → EatSalads(x)) ::: All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.\n∀x (NutritionalIntake(x) → GrewUp(x, y)) ::: All people who fulfill their nutritional daily intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.\n∀x (Relationship(x, y) → Visit(x, y)) ::: If people have good relationships with their parents, then they visit them at least once a day.\n(Taylor ∧ ¬(GrewUp(Taylor, y) ∨ Relationship(Taylor, y))) ⊕ ¬(Taylor ∨ ¬(Taylor ∧ Visit(Taylor, y))) ::: Taylor is either a person who grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and has a good relationship with her parents, or neither a person who grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents.\n###\n\nI will provide the first-order logic formular for the problem and the question, and then I will explain how to parse them.\n\nFor the problem:\n\n¬(Dependent(x) ∧ Student(x)) ∨ (Dependent(x) ∧ ¬Student(x))\n\nThis formula can be parsed as:\n\nNot (Dependent(x) and Student(x)) or (Dependent(x) and not Student(x))\n\nFor the question:\n\nJokes(rina) ⊕ Unaware(rina)\n\nThis formula can be parsed as:\n\n(Rina jokes about being addicted to caffeine or Rina is unaware that caffeine is a drug)\n\nIn first-order logic, the logical negation of a formula is denoted by ¬, the logical conjunction by ∧, the logical disjunction by ∨, the logical exclusive disjunction by ⊕, and the logical universal quantification by ∀.\n\nTo parse a formula, we need to identify the predicates (functions) and the individuals (variables) in the formula. In the problem, the predicates are Dependent, Student, Drinks, Jokes, and Unaware, and the individuals are x. In the question, the predicates are Jokes and Unaware, and the individual is rina.\n\nWe can then use the grammar rules to build the formula from the predicates and individuals. For example, the formula ¬(Dependent(x) ∧ Student(x)) can be built by first identifying the predicates Dependent and Student, and then using the logical negation ¬ to negate the conjunction of the two predicates.\n\nOnce we have the first-order logic formular for the problem and the question, we can use logical reasoning to determine the truth value of the statement. For example, to determine whether the statement \"Rina jokes about being addicted to caffeine or is unaware that caffeine is a drug\" is true or false, we can use the formula ¬(Dependent(rina) ∧ Student(rina)) ⊕ ¬(Dependent(rina) ∨ Student(rina)) to reason about the truth value of the statement."
