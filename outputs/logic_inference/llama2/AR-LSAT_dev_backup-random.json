The following pieces of information concerning the spread of the virus have been established: No computer transmitted the virus to more than two other computers on the network. S transmitted the virus to exactly one other computer on the network. The computer that transmitted the virus to R also transmitted it to S. Either R or T transmitted the virus to Q. Either T or U transmitted the virus to P.",
