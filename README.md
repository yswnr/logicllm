# Logic-LLM for flan-T5 and Llama 2

## Initial Setup
1. Download the git repository
2. Upload to Google Drive (for Colab usage)
3. Load the `.ipynb` file into Colab
4. Change directory to logic llm:
5. Install required libraries and tools in the notebook
6. Run helper functions
7. Load model and tokenizer:
    - Configure based on chosen LLM (flan-T5 or Llama 2)

## Running Experiments
1. Execute Chain of Thought (CoT) experiments
2. Run Direct inference experiments
3. Generate logic programs

## Logic Inference and Self Refinement
1. Navigate to models directory:
2. Execute all `.py` files (symbolic solvers)
3. Run logic inference
4. Perform self refinement
