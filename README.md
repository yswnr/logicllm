# Logic-LLM for flan-T5 and Llama 2

## download the git repository and upload in gdrive(for this project we ve used colab) #
## load the ipynb file into colab #
 change the directory to logic llm #

# install and import all the necessary libraries and tools in the ipynb file
# run the helper functions
# load the model and tokenizer based on the llm to be used
# run the experiments for CoT,Direct and generate the logic programs

# for logic inference and self refinement go to the models directory in LogicLLM
# run all the .py files(these are the files for symbolic solvers)

# now run the logic inference and self refinement
# make sure that all the paths are adjusted accordingly and all the necessary files are present
