In this case, the context describes a set of objects arranged in a fixed order, and you need to use the information provided in the context to determine which of the given options is true.\n\nThe key to solving this type of question is to carefully read the context and identify the relationships between the objects or the statements provided in the context. Once you have identified the relationships, you can use them to determine which of the given options is true.\n\nIn the first question, the key relationship is that Dan finished third, and Ana finished above Ada. Based on this information, you can determine that Dan did not finish third, so the correct option is D.\n\nIn the second question, the key relationship is that the orange book is to the left of the white book. Based on this information, you can determine that the orange book is the second from the left, so the correct option is B.\n\nIn the third question, the key relationship is that the yellow table is to the right of the green table. Based on this information, you can determine that the yellow table is not to the left of the green table, so the correct option is C."
